# MC_STIX_data
### Introductory course to Hard X-ray quicklooks, spectroscopy and visibilities with STIX 

Done for a Master Class for the M2 IRT of the paris observatory. Used for formation (Years 2022-2024)

Brief overview of spectrogram and pixel data from the instrument [STIX](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202346031) onboard [Solar Orbiter](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter). The tutorial course aims at explaining the data structure of the STIX files, as well as preliminary analysis on spectroscopy (on counts spectra) and visibility reconstruction (no imagng yet). This tutorial is not an official code of the Solar Orbiter team and under no circumstance should be referenced as such. This is just a teaching tool to introduce master students to the STIX instrument, its data products and the nuances of modern solar observations in HXRs. More information on STIX data products and further analysis of its data available in the [STIX Data Center](https://datacenter.stix.i4ds.net/).
